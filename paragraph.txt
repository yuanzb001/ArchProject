Computer architectures represent the means of interconnectivity for a computer's hardware components as well as the mode of data transfer and processing exhibited. Different computer architecture configurations have been developed to speed up the movement of data, allowing for increased data processing. The basic architecture has the CPU at the core with a main memory and input output system on either side of the CPU. A second computer configuration is the central input/output controller (see Figure 1.8). A third computer architecture uses the main memory as the location in the computer system from which all data and instructions flow in and out.
